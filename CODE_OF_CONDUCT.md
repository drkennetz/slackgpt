## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Unacceptable Behavior:
If you encounter any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please immediately notify the Project maintainers by email at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. If possible, please include a description of the behavior and the identity of the person involved. 

## Consequences:
If the Project determines that a participant has engaged in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, it may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the participant, banning the participant from the Project, or reporting the participant to the appropriate authorities. 

## Modifications:
The Project reserves the right to modify this Code of Conduct at any time, and will make such modifications available to all participants.
